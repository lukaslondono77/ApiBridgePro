## 📸 Sponsor Section with Avatar (Automatic!)

The "Sponsor this project" section will **automatically show**:

```
Sponsor this project
┌─────────────┐
│    👤       │  ← Your GitHub avatar (automatic!)
│   Photo     │
└─────────────┘
Lukas Londono  ← Your name (from FUNDING.yml)
                  Links to: https://github.com/lukaslondono77

This is **already configured** via `.github/FUNDING.yml`!
